ðŸ”¥ How to establish a connection:
- Please download both backend and frontend repositories from github.com.
- Go to the MERN-ecommerce-Frontend-main directory in terminal and run `npm install --force` command to download the required packages.
- We need to use the `--force` command as some of the packages such as `spinner`,`alert`, used in the project are not compatible with the latest version of MERN.
- Now in terminal run `npm run start` command, If you can see `webpack compiled` in terminal. It means everything is working fine.
- Switch to any browser, the paste the url `http://localhost:3000`, this will redirect to the `ecommerce` website.
