## TLG

This is a short `MERN Stack` project prepared for the `TLG`, in accordance with the instructions provided in the pdf file by `Mrs Giulia`.

### The project has five main pages:

- Login page
- Registration page
- Contact Us page
- Content Feed page
- Wishlist page (Cart)
- 
### Tools used:
- Mongo DB 
- Node js for backend 
- Express on top of Node js 
- React for frontend 
- Cloudinary
- bcrypt
- JWT

### For design:

I have used CSS and Material Ui for designing, I also wanted to use Redux and Bootstrap. But then it would have become messy so I didnâ€™t.

### To Start:

- cd root folder
- Run npm install on the root directory and on client directory
- Then run npm start on both the directory/ or just run npm run    dev on the root directory.

### Exceptions:

As described in the pdf file the user can select stuff from the contented page and add it to the cart.

I have used Cloudinary in order to fetch data and display it to the content feed page, after that according to the user, then can add, increment or decrement things in the cart and also view it.

It was working fine, but when I was try to improvise it, I ran into error. As I am running out of time so I am submitting it like this, If one will look at the code, it will be clear that the code works.
